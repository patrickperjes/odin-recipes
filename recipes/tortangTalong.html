    <p>There is really nothing special about this recipe, except for the fact that tortang talong is a quick and good dish to prepare. I liked how it tastes when eaten with ketchup and rice (I am leaning towards banana ketchup for this dish).</p>
    <p>In addition, it is perfect for vegetarians (not vegans though since it has egg) and for those who want to skip meat even for a short period of time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Chinese eggplant</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the eggplant directly over fire in a stovetop until the skin of the eggplant turns brown to black, Rotate after a few minutes until all parts of are almost burnt.</li>
        <li>Let the eggplant cooldown and then peel the skin off using your fingers. The inside part of the eggplant should be steamed just right at this point.</li>
        <li>Arrange the peeled eggplant in a plate and then flatten using a fork. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg in a bowl and add salt and pepper. Continue beating until the salt and pepper are well blended.</li>
